Patient compliance remains a significant challenge in healthcare, with many individuals failing to take medications as prescribed. Educational programs and reminder systems help improve adherence rates, though socioeconomic factors also play important roles in medication access and compliance.

Different drug delivery methods offer various advantages and disadvantages. Oral medications provide convenience but may have slower onset times compared to intravenous administration. Topical preparations work well for localized conditions while avoiding systemic side effects.

Healthcare providers must consider drug interactions when prescribing multiple medications simultaneously. Some combinations can reduce effectiveness while others may increase toxicity risks. Regular monitoring helps identify potential problems before they become serious.
